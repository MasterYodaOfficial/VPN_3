"<b>❓ Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)</b>\n"
"\n"
"<b>Q: How many devices can I use with one subscription?</b>\n"
"A: One subscription is for one device only. This keeps your IP stable and the speed high. For more devices, you can get additional subscriptions.\n"
"\n"
"<b>Q: Do you keep logs of my activity?</b>\n"
"A: No. We strictly follow a No-Logs policy. Your activity is completely anonymous.\n"
"\n"
"<b>Q: What if my connection is slow?</b>\n"
"A: Try reconnecting. In Happ or Hiddify apps, enable the \"Auto ⚡️\" mode — it will connect you to the fastest server automatically.\n"
"\n"
"<b>Q: VPN won’t connect, what should I do?</b>\n"
"A: 1. Check your internet connection.\n"
"   2. Restart your device.\n"
"   3. Remove the subscription from the app and add it again via the bot.\n"
"   4. If nothing helps — contact support.\n"
